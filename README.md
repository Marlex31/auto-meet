# Meeting automation

This tool is used for accessing the Adservio.ro site and automatically joining the video meetings.

Made in Python 3, using __Selenium__ for browser automation and __PySimpleGUI__ for the front-end.
You'll also need the appropriate [__Chromedriver__](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) version in the script directory, Windows folder or as a PATH variable.

Disclaimer: very slow on startup and buggy.
